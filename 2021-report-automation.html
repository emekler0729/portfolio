                roughly 5 minutes
                while increasing quality & consistency of report output. Enabled Product Management team to focus on
                using report insights to manage business rather than collating data.

            <h2 class="text-dark my-4">Need</h2>
            <p class="text-dark">
                Business analyzes sales performance by product line on a monthly basis. Analysis is performed on
                invoiced
                sales, booked sales, and sales pipeline to measure performance against expectations. Additionally, data
                is sliced by sales regions, various
                timescales, and by both dollars & units.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-dark my-4">Challenge</h2>
            <p class="text-dark">
                Product Management team (team of 5) was spending up to 40 man-hours per month generating reports
                that were requested by Senior Leadership team. Data needed to be assembled from three independent
                systems.
            <ul class="text-dark">
                <li>Accounting system for Invoiced Sales</li>
                <li>Order Processing system for Booked Sales</li>
                <li>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system for Sales Pipeline</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="text-dark">
                The report format, naming conventions, and layout differred for each data source. As a result,
                data was being manually categorized which was time-consuming and error-prone.
            </p>
            <p class="text-dark">
                Templates were being managed on each contributors local computer which resulted in variance over
                time and an inconsistent output from product line to product line on the final report.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-dark my-4">Solution</h2>
            <p class="text-dark">
                Developed a Python program to to process data sources (accommodating for differences in layout and
                nomeclature) and develop a unified data model.
            </p>

            <p class="text-dark">
                Processed data was then interpolated and fed into a Excel-based template engine to output chart and
                graph formats that were being created manually. Using Excel-based templates also allowed for future
                modifications to the format/presentation without changes being required to the program
            </p>

            <p class="text-dark">
                Automation of report generation process allowed for identification of even deeper insights due to time
                saved on compiling basic data. Additionally, report quality, accuracy, & consistently greatly improved
                for all contributors.
