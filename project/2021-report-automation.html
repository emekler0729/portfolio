            <p>Reduced time to generate monthly product reports from up to 40 man-hours each month to roughly 5 minutes
                while increasing quality & consistency of report output. Enabled Product Management team to focus on
                using report insights to manage business rather than collating data.

            <h2>Need</h2>
            <p>
                Business analyzed sales performance by product line a monthly basis. Analysis is done on invoiced
                sales, booked sales, and sales pipeline. Additionally, data is sliced by sales regions, various
                timescales, and by both dollars & units.
            </p>
            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                Product Management team (5 team members) was spending up to 40 man-hours per month collating analysis
                that was requested by Senior Leadership team. Data needed to be assembled from three independent
                systems.
            <ul>
                <li>Invoiced Sales - Accounting System</li>
                <li>Booked Sales - Order Processing System</li>
                <li>Sales Pipeline - Customer Relationship Management System</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, report format, naming conventions, and layout differred for each data source. As a result,
                data was being manually categorized which was time-consuming and error-prone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, templates were being managed on each contributors local computer which resulted in variance over
                time and an inconsistent presentation from product line to product line on final report.
            </p>
